    <h1>This is the Main Heading!</h1>
    <P>This text might be an introduction to the rest of the page. And if the page is a long one it might be split up into several sub-headings.

    <h2>This is a Sub-Heading</h2>
    <p>Many long articles have sub-headings so to help you follow the structure of what is being written. There may even be sub-sub-headings (or lower-level headings)

    </p>
    <p>What should this be?</p>

   <h2>Another Sub-Heading</h2>
    <p>Here you can see another sub-heading. But should this be a heading? Probably not. Too much info/text now.</p>
    <span>right?</span>
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <P>add a few "breaks" here to create some space! **hint** you can also use these to<br />break sentences into new lines... as it was intended to be used! try using one in the middle<br />of a paragraph and see what happens in your browser.</P>
        
    <h2>And Another Sub-Heading</h2>
    <P><strong>More headings??</strong> Here you can see another sub-heading.<br />You know what to do now. Let's use a proper tag. </P>
    <h2>Yet Another Sub-Heading</h2>
    <p>That's a lot of headings. Here you can see another sub-heading. You know what to do now.  Make this <b>WORD</b> strong aka bold. Give it a proper tag!</p>
